# TestEverything

This is a practice repository for automated testing with selenium.

We started using selenium on the first sprint and now we are structuring it using POM design pattern.
Also we started to parameterize tests using JUnit API.

We created a CI branch for Jenkins integration. The pipeline script is stored in the git repository called 'Jenkinsfile'.
When we push a new commit to github the Jenkins pipeline runs the tests automatically.
